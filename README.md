> A simple starter repo for a Webpack 4 project.

- Production and development modes
- Babel transpiling from ES6 to ES5
- Webpack Dev Server

## Usage

## Todo

- Add support for SCSS
  - Most of the time I use SCSS when coding styles.
- ESLint + Prettier integration
  - For consistent code styling.
